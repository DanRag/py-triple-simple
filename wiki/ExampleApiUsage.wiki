#summary An example of how to use the API in a novel Python program

= Introduction =

The example here goes through creating a visualization for [http://gephi.org/ Gephi] of a RDF class structure and the relations between different classes.

= Details =

The source for this example is in the program [http://code.google.com/p/py-triple-simple/source/browse/trunk/src/generate_class_instances_graph.py generate_class_instances_graph.py]

We import the pyTripleSimple into pyt namespace and the GephiGexf xml
generator class.
{{{
import pyTripleSimple as pyt
from gexf import GephiGexf
}}}

Now we can initialize triple store
{{{
ts = pyt.SimpleTripleStore() #Create a triple store object
}}}
and load the N-triples file. 
{{{
f = open(ntriples_file_name)
ts.load_ntriples(f)
}}}
Your n-triples file is now in memory with indices on subjects, predicates, and objects. Everything is in memory so a large 10 million triple file can consume up to 10 gigabytes of RAM.
