#summary Generating GraphML from an N-triples (RDF) file

= Introduction =

At the lowest level the semantic Web is built on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is a graph model. It would be expected that a large range of network analytical tools could be directly applied to a RDF data set. Most network algorithms assume that a graph does not have parallel edges which the RDF model allows. The challenge is to pull out simpler graphs from the RDF "hairball" for analysis. Py-triple-simple can generate GraphML file from a N-triples file.
