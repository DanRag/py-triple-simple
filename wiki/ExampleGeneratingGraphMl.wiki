#summary Generating GraphML from an N-triples (RDF) file

= Introduction =

At the lowest level the semantic Web is built on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is a graph model. It would be expected that a wide range of network analytical tools could be directly applied to a RDF data set. However, most network algorithms assume that a graph does not have parallel edges which the RDF model allows. The challenge is to pull out simpler graphs from the RDF "hairball" for analysis. Py-triple-simple can generate GraphML file from a N-triples file. GraphML, an XML based format, is a standard for graph interchange. In this example we generate a publication co-authorship network from an RDF dump of a VIVO site.
